# pandas-challenge

All the files for the pandas challenge and analaysis.
The analysis is based on the data provided in two CSV files for schools and students for the district.

##Steps

- Setup dependencies and setup,
- Read the two files they provide for the data analysis,
- Combine the data into a single dataset,
- Calculate the total number of unique schools(I use the len to get the total results, if not use the len it will show each unique value for schools),
- Calculate the total number of students(I used the len to get the total value if students),
- Calculate the total budget(Need to use the school data to summarize the budget, because if you use the merged data can have duplicate value of budget, it will be add more times than needed and give wrong results).
- Calculate the average of math score,
- Calculate the average of reading score,
- Calculate the percentage of students passed in reading or math and students pass in reading and in math,
- Create high-level snapshot,
- Show the all types of schools,
- Calculate total students per school, total budget fopr school, per capita spending per school, average the test scores,
- Sort school by Overall pssing the Top5 higher and Top 5 lower scores,
- Math Scores by Grade,
- Reading Scores by Grade,
- Scores by School Spending,
- Scores by School Size,
- Scores by School Type.
